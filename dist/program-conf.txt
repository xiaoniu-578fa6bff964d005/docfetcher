# General program settings

# Some tips:
# * Use the '#' character at the beginning of a line to comment it out.
# * Changes will take effect after the program is restarted.
# * To restore the defaults, simply delete this file. It will be recreated the
#   next time the program is started.

# The text to display in the title bar of the main window and in the task bar.
# This setting might be useful for rebranding and for using multiple instances
# of DocFetcher.
AppName = DocFetcher

# Whether to show a link to this file on the preferences dialog. Disable this
# setting to prevent users from mucking around in this file.
ShowAdvancedSettingsLink = true

# If this is true, the program will not store changes made by the user to the
# sizes of the various program windows. Instead, it will always reload the last
# saved sizes on startup.
FixWindowSizes = false

# Whether to use curvy or rectangular tabs.
CurvyTabs = false

# Whether to use colored tabs.
ColoredTabs = true

# HTML file extensions. This setting will affect detection of HTML files and
# DocFetcher's HTML pairing mechanism.
HtmlExtensions = html;htm;xhtml;shtml;shtm;php;asp;jsp

# The maximum number of lines to display in the indexing progress panel. When
# the number of lines exceeds this limit, lines at the top will be discarded.
# Setting a value that is too high may cause the program to crash with an
# OutOfMemoryError.
MaxLinesInProgressPanel = 1000

# The size limit of the search history, which can be accessed through the
# drop-down menu next to the search text field.
SearchHistorySize = 20

# The maximum width of the search text field in pixels.
SearchBoxMaxWidth = 200

# By default, DocFetcher initially sorts the results by score. To change the
# initial sorting criterion, specify the number of the column to sort by here.
# The numbering starts at 1. Zero and out-of-range values will be ignored.
# If the value is negative, the sorting is reversed, e.g. "-2" means "sort by
# second column, but in reversed order".
InitialSorting = 0

# Desktop interface: The maximum number of search results to return for each
# query. If you set a value that is too high, DocFetcher may crash with an
# OutOfMemoryError while searching.
MaxResultsTotal = 10000

# Web interface: The maximum number of search results to display on a single
# page. (Note: The web interface is not available yet.)
WebInterfacePageSize = 50

# The height of the regex table on the indexing dialog, measured (approximately)
# in number of visible rows.
PatternTableHeight = 4

# This setting determines whether DocFetcher indexes a formula in an MS Excel
# file as is, or whether it indexes the formula's result instead. For example,
# if a cell contains the formula "=2+2", DocFetcher will either literally
# extract "=2+2" from the cell, or "4", depending on this setting's value.
# Changes to this setting will immediately affect the preview pane, but not the
# indexes, so you'll have to rebuild the latter after the change.
IndexExcelFormulas = true

# If this is set to true, all text extraction during indexing will be disabled.
# Mainly useful for debugging.
DryRun = false

# The capacity of the unpack cache. The latter holds archive entries that were
# unpacked for display in the preview pane and makes sure they won't get deleted
# immediately. The oldest entries are deleted first when this capacity limit
# is reached. The cache is cleared when the program terminates.
UnpackCacheCapacity = 20

# The type of analyzer used during indexing.
# 0 = StandardAnalyzer
# 1 = SourceCodeAnalyzer
# Among other things, this option has an effect on how the raw document text is
# split into words. The StandardAnalyzer is suitable in most cases, but the
# SourceCodeAnalyzer may give better results for source code files (e.g. it
# splits words containing dots, such as 'list.iterator').
# Important: After changing this option, you must rebuild all existing indexes,
# otherwise you might get inconsistent search results.
Analyzer = 0

# Whether the user is allowed to create, update, rebuild and remove indexes,
# respectively. Disabling any of these setings will hide the respective context
# menu entries in the Search Scope pane.
AllowIndexCreation = true
AllowIndexUpdate = true
AllowIndexRebuild = true
AllowIndexDeletion = true

# By default, when DocFetcher starts up it checks the index folder for any
# obsolete index files, and if it finds any, it asks the user whether the files
# should be deleted. You can turn this off with this setting.
ReportObsoleteIndexFiles = true
