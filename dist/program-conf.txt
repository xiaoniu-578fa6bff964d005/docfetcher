#===============================================================================
#	General
#===============================================================================

# The text to display in the title bar of the main window and in the task bar.
# This setting might be useful for rebranding and for using multiple instances
# of DocFetcher.
# You can also rename the main help files (by default "DocFetcher_Manual.html")
# and their associated HTML folders if you want. If you do the latter, you'll
# have to update the hyperlinks in the HTML files.
AppName = DocFetcher

# By default, when DocFetcher starts up it checks the index folder for any
# obsolete index files, and if it finds any, it asks the user whether the files
# should be deleted. You can turn this off with this setting.
ReportObsoleteIndexFiles = true

# Whether to show a link to this file on the preferences dialog. Disable this
# setting to prevent users from mucking around in this file.
ShowAdvancedSettingsLink = true

# Whether the user is allowed to create, update, rename, rebuild or remove
# indexes, respectively. Disabling any of these setings will hide the respective
# context menu entries in the Search Scope pane.
AllowIndexCreation = true
AllowIndexUpdate = true
AllowIndexRenaming = true
AllowIndexRebuild = true
AllowIndexDeletion = true

# If this is true, the program will not store changes made by the user to the
# sizes of the various program windows. Instead, it will always reload the last
# saved sizes on startup.
FixWindowSizes = false

# Whether any changes to the program settings should be written to disk.
SaveSettings = true


#===============================================================================
#	Indexing
#===============================================================================

# HTML file extensions. This setting will affect detection of HTML files and
# DocFetcher's HTML pairing mechanism.
HtmlExtensions = html;htm;xhtml;shtml;shtm;php;asp;jsp

# The height of the regex table on the indexing dialog, measured (approximately)
# in number of visible rows.
PatternTableHeight = 4

# The maximum number of lines to display in the indexing progress panel. When
# the number of lines exceeds this limit, lines at the top will be discarded.
# Setting a value that is too high may cause the program to crash with an
# OutOfMemoryError.
MaxLinesInProgressPanel = 1000

# If this is set to true, all text extraction during indexing will be disabled.
# Mainly useful for debugging.
DryRun = false

# The type of analyzer used during indexing.
# 0 = StandardAnalyzer
# 1 = SourceCodeAnalyzer
# Among other things, this option has an effect on how the raw document text is
# split into words. The StandardAnalyzer is suitable in most cases, but the
# SourceCodeAnalyzer may give better results for source code files (e.g. it
# splits words containing dots, such as 'list.iterator').
# Important: After changing this option, you must restart DocFetcher and then
# rebuild all existing indexes, otherwise you might get inconsistent search
# results.
Analyzer = 0

# Whether support for tar archives is disabled. If disabled, tar archives will
# be treated as ordinary files. Set this to true if you experience tar-related
# issues, e.g. your temporary directory filling up with tzp*.tmp files, or just
# want to speed up indexing by completely avoiding the unpacking of tar
# archives.
SkipTarArchives = false

# Whether DocFetcher should follow or ignore NTFS junctions and symlinks during
# indexing. Normally, DocFetcher ignores them in order to avoid getting stuck
# in circular folder structures.
IgnoreJunctionsAndSymlinks = true

# This setting determines whether DocFetcher indexes a formula in an MS Excel
# file as is, or whether it indexes the formula's result instead. For example,
# if a cell contains the formula "=2+2", DocFetcher will either literally
# extract "=2+2" from the cell, or "4", depending on this setting's value.
# Changes to this setting will immediately affect the preview pane, but not the
# indexes, so you'll have to rebuild the latter after the change.
IndexExcelFormulas = true

# Plain text files (e.g. files with extension ".txt") don't contain any explicit
# text encoding information, so when DocFetcher parses them, it has to use
# heuristics to determine the encoding. This might not always give the correct
# result; if that happens, you can use this setting to disable the heuristics
# and specify the text encoding manually. For example, set this setting's value
# to "GBK" for Simplified Chinese GBK encoding. For a list of available
# encodings, see:
# http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encoding.doc.html
# If the above link doesn't work, google for "java supported encodings".
TextEncodingOverride =


#===============================================================================
#	Searching, results and preview
#===============================================================================

# The maximum width of the search text field in pixels.
SearchBoxMaxWidth = 500

# The size limit of the search history, which can be accessed through the
# drop-down menu next to the search text field.
SearchHistorySize = 20

# By default, DocFetcher initially sorts the results by score. To change the
# initial sorting criterion, specify the number of the column to sort by here.
# The numbering starts at 1. Zero and out-of-range values will be ignored.
# If the value is negative, the sorting is reversed, e.g. "-2" means "sort by
# second column, but in reversed order".
InitialSorting = 0

# The maximum number of search results to return for each query. If you set a
# value that is too high, DocFetcher may crash with an OutOfMemoryError while
# searching.
# This setting is primarily used for capping memory consumption and search time
# when dealing with very large indexes. It is not recommended to use this
# setting for trimming down the the results, since a low value for this setting
# will cause DocFetcher to try to pick an equal number of results from each
# index (rather than picking the highest-scoring results across all indexes).
MaxResultsTotal = 10000

# The capacity of the unpack cache. The latter holds archive entries that were
# unpacked for display in the preview pane and makes sure they won't get deleted
# immediately. The oldest entries are deleted first when this capacity limit
# is reached. The cache is cleared when the program terminates.
UnpackCacheCapacity = 20
