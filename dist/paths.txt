# In this configuration file you can customize the paths where DocFetcher will
# look for its settings and index files. This file follows the conventions of
# the Java Properties format. In particular, the following rules apply:
# * Lines starting with '#' are considered comments and will be ignored. Remove
#   the '#' characters in front of the "key=value" lines below to enable the
#   respective settings.
# * Backslashes must be escaped, i.e. whenever you want to write down a '\'
#   character, insert '\\' instead.
# * Other characters to be escaped with a backslash include ' and ". Thus, you
#   have to enter \' and \" instead.
# * The expected encoding is ISO-8859-1, aka Latin-1. All non-Latin-1 characters
#   must be entered as Unicode escapes, e.g. '\u00F6' instead of 'ö'.
# You can specify relative paths with ".." (two dots), which means "go up one
# level in the folder hierarchy". Relative paths are relative to the DocFetcher
# folder, not to this file. Example: ..\\some\\folder
# For more information on the Properties format, see:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties

# Where the settings are stored:
#settings=C:\\path\\to\\settings\\folder

# Where the indexes are stored:
#indexes=C:\\path\\to\\indexes\\folder
