Show manual on startup  |  Whether to open the manual when DocFetcher starts up.
Use OR operator as default in queries (instead of AND)  |  If checked, DocFetcher will treat consecutive words in a query as if they were concatenated with the `OR` operator. Otherwise, the `AND` operator will be used. See the [query syntax](Query_Syntax.html) for more.
Hide program in System Tray after opening files  |  If checked, DocFetcher will automatically hide in the System Tray whenever you double-click a file on the result pane, or open a folder from the `Search Scope` area.
Clear search history on exit  |  If checked, DocFetcher will wipe out its history of entered queries on exit.
Highlight color  |  The color to use for higlighting matches in the text preview.
Preview font (normal)  |  The font to use in the text preview; applies to all document formats except plain text files.
Preview font (fixed width)  |  The font to use for the text preview; applies only to plain text files. You are not required to pick a fixed-width font here, although it's usually a sensible choice.
Global hotkey  |  The keyboard shortcut specified here can be used to move the DocFetcher window to the top after it has lost focus.
